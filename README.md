CDiCloudIcon
============

a cloud image for iOS drawn in Core Graphics, no image files required. You're welcome.

This is a simple subclass of UIView, uses a UIBezierPath to draw arcs and then closes the path.
Default colour is white border with white fill.

If you'd like to us it in your iOS app feel free, just give me/it a quick mention somewhere in the app, settings or about page.
Basically just share the love, it'd be nice if it ended up being ubiquitous.

TODO:
-----
Line widths greater than 1 draw outside the frame currently, needs fixing to adjust based on line width.

Provide an alternative initializer to allow specification of stroke colour, stroke width and fill colours.
